    College Of Engineering Roorkee (COER)- Introdution</span>
    <br/><br/>
    
    <span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#C03; font-size:16px; font-weight:600;">COER: Modesty in Creativity</span> <br/><br/>
 
All in all, offering the very best in learning for the students' evolution as better individuals. No one can afford to miss out on anything. COER - A complete learning cycle is for the best of minds. COER will act as a harbinger of a movement that will give impetus to the process of enriching knowledge. It will act as a precursor to a movement that would not only make the community and country proud, but also will pave the path for a better value and ethics driven society.<br/><br/>

College of Engineering Roorkee (COER) is located at Roorkee. The town of Roorkee located on the national highway (NH-58) about 180 km north of Delhi.
The COER campus situated on NH-58, just 7 km from Roorkee offers an enchanting site with 75 acres of lush green pollution free atmosphere. Affiliated to Uttarakhand Technical University (UTU), Dehradun and recognized by All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE). The campus provides an enchanting site on the busy highway that catches the eye of every passer-by.<br/>
College of Engineering Roorkee was established in the year of 1998 at the city of Roorkee which is famous for its metal machining industry and the Indian Institute Of Technology Roorkee. it’s been a long road to become the BEST Engineering Institute in Uttarakhand and one of the renowned names in engineering in North India. 
<br/><br/>
"COER" is a brand name that gets finally establishment on the minds of young would-be technocrats. The petals of COER open with the name College of Engineering Roorkee, a peerless champion in the world of facilitator of Technical Education. A progenitor, profounder and harbinger COER has already created movement that would not only make the community and country proud, but also will pave the path for a better value and ethics driven society.
The heart of the matter behind the COER is an idea to expose the students to the world of technology, instilling in them confidence to face new challenges enabling them to shine in their chosen fields. Our core values are quality, equity, morality, environmental sustainability, energy saving and strong commitment to the cause of technical education and services.
<br/><br/>
<span style="font-weight:400;">COER currently has the following departments of engineering running successfully: </span><br/><br/>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Department of CS</li>
<li>Department of IT</li>
<li>Department of AEI</li>
<li>Department of EN</li>
<li>Department of ET</li>
<li>Department of ME</li>
<li>Department of Civil Engg.</li>
<li>Department of MBA</li>
<li>Department of MCA</li>
<li>Department of Basic Sciences</li>
</ul>

To motivate COERians for overall development, several committees have been constituted to plan and implement various programmes. The committees mainly consisting of student members draw out the plan of action and implement the same under the guidance of faculty members.<br/>
<span style="font-weight:400;"> A list of committees continues: </span><br/><br/>
<ul type="square">
<li>Abhyudaya- The Literary Committee</li>

<li>Disha- The Technical Committee</li>

<li> Oorja-The Cultural Committee</li>

    The Robotics And Innovation Club - Introdution</span>
    <br/><br/>
    <ul type="disc">
<li>The Robotics And Innovation club was established (officially) in January 2010. The Titans, the team for Robocon from College of Engineering Roorkee was formed on 15/9/2007, by handful of budding first yearlings. The long journey of officialising the club started in 2008-09 but it was until Jan. 2010 that the official recognition was granted. At present the club is under the able guidance of Dr.Kamal Kapoor who is the convenor of the club.</li>

<li>Given below are the names of the founding members of The Robotics And Innovation Club who laid the foundation of the club with a vision to make C.O.E.R a prominent name in the field of robotics.</li>
<ul type="square">
<li>Vatsalya Sharma – Dept. of Mechanical Engineering (2007-2011)</li>
<li>Abhishek Pathak - Dept. of Mechanical Engineering(2007-2011)</li>
<li>Nikhil Sharma – Dept. of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering(2007-2011)</li>
<li>Punit Kumar – Dept. of Information Technology(2007-2011)</li>
</ul>

<li>TRAIC works under the motto that we need to incorporate the thinking of a true engineer in all those who have a zeal and passion to follow it.</li>

<li>We have gradually expanded our horizons from mere robotics to Research-and-Development of several industry level projects. Our on-going projects have the capability to shape the future of upcoming generations.</li>

<li>Each year we take a fresh bunch of enthusiastic individuals from all branches of engineering after a rigorous round of scrutiny through Interview-panel which consists of senior-most TRAIC members. After testing them for the necessary passion, we gradually train them to be the best when it comes to applied technical knowledge. </li>

<li>The club tries to create a common platform where students from different years, different branches having different technical skills can come together to share and enhance their skills and work together to achieve something big.</li>
<li>The path followed by a person who joins T.R.A.I.C right from the trainee to the member stage is of learning, implementing and then giving it back to the upcoming generations. Each generation of the club not only learns from the previous generation but also expands the existing knowledge base and passes it onto the next generation. In this way we preserve the knowledge and experience of our seniors and increase our own efficiency.</li> 

<li>The aim of each generation in T.R.A.I.C is to make the next generation better than the previous generation.</li>
<li>We have been organising several classes each working semester thereby training fresh batch of entrants to be a fully-fledged TRAIC member in due course of time.</li>

    Aim of the club</span><br/><br/>
    <ul type="disc">
<li>21st century has been marked as the century of artificial intelligence and automation. Being the Engineers of tomorrow we must keep in pace with the times and get acquainted with new technologies. The Robotics and Innovation Club aims to promote technological and engineering knowhow and hands on experience to engineering students and instill a tradition of true engineering ethics. </li>

<li>The age of computers will be followed by the age of Robots. Students must have the very basic knowledge of robotics right from their first year.</li>
<li>We look to impart more practical knowledge to the students. An engineer is incomplete without practical knowledge Any form of knowledge is incomplete until it is implemented. </li>
<li>STUDENT DEVELOPMENT – Robotics enables students to gain hands on experience of field of engineering. It develops cooperation amongst team members, instills passion amongst individuals for their respective fields and develops the spirit of competition. </li>
<li>INTER-DISCIPLINARY TEAMWORK – For professionalism in our work we require perfect synchronization of electrical, mechanical and coding. For perfect functioning of bots the work in all these areas is inter-dependent. So each department has to design its work keeping in mind the limitations of others. It promotes team work and spirit of collaborative learning.</li>
<li>To Prepare and participate in the National Robotics Championship called ROBOCON and various other Techfests organized around the country.</li>
