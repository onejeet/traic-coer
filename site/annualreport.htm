This year a total of 35 trainees were enrolled and there was an exceptional rise in the total number of sessions of the trainees. Apart from the theoretical sessions, practical sessions were also held at the T.R.A.I.C Lab and an event on constructing  a basic manual robot was held at the end of the odd semester which was a huge success and more than 40 students participated in the event.</li>
<li>Shashank Kumar (EN-2ND YEAR), Awik Sinha (ET-2ND YEAR), Sandeep Saurav (ET-2ND YEAR) and Vikrant Negi (ET-2ND YEAR) stood 1st in the line follower contest at TechSpardha’11, the annual technical fest of Meerut Institute of Technology, Meerut. This was for the 2nd consecutive time that members of T.R.A.I.C had won the competition.</li>
<li>Pushkar Shukla (ET-3RD YEAR), Hitesh Tripathi (ET-3RD YEAR), Shailesh Bisht(ET-3RD YEAR) and Lokesh Lohani (ME -2ND YEAR) stood 2nd  in inter college level exhibition held at J.B. Institute of  Technology out of 89  teams.</li>
<li>Pushkar Shukla (ET-3RD YEAR), Hitesh Tripathi (ET-3RD YEAR), Shailesh Bisht(ET-3RD YEAR) stood 1st in Dynamo gauge at Neuron’12, the annual technical fest of NIT Jaipur. The participants were asked to design a contact less tachometer using self-made modules.</li>

<li>Varun Joshi (ME-2ND YEAR) created a RC Controlled Aeroplane which was able to complete a successful flight. This project inspired other members of the club to work on aerodynamics. The project was presented at the exhibition held on 17/9/12.</li>
<li>Shailesh Bisht (ET- 3RD YEAR) designed 3*3*3 Led Cube used for 3-D display. The project was presented at the exhibition held on 17/9/12.</li>
<li>Pushkar Shukla (ET- 3RD YEAR) did a project on “Detection of shape drawn by human finger using a Camera”. A human finger was covered with a strap and a camera was used a sensor for detecting the position of the strap.</li>
